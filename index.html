  <h2>A bit about myself</h2>
  <p>I'm trying to think of the first time I encountered coding, and it must go all the way to high school, when we were taught basics of  Logo. At the time I found it almost too easy and too... simple - drawing circles and squares has a limited scope, after all.</p>
  <p>It wasn't until more recently that I started to think of coding more seriously.</p>
  <p>A charity I worked for was a DBS umbrella organisation and we were responsible for keeping track of applications. The only way of seeing if a certificate was issued, was to go to a particular website, input the form code and some other information. My lovely boss was doing it manually without complaining. Then she went on holiday. One day I decided to help out and do some of the tracking. Suffice to say that within 10 minutes I started to think how to automate the process. With help of a friend, I built a little script which cut down human involvement of the process from hours to minutes. I spoke with said boss recently, and she disclosed that the charity has been able to continue taking on new clients for this service, and that this would not have been possible without the little script and the difference it makes in human time needed for the process. I am hoping to expand the functionality of the script to deal with potential errors (the script is currently bare-bones-does-the-job), as well as a GUI.</p>
  <p>One of my major motivators in life is to make a difference; to streamline and optimise processes. I think that pursuing a career in Software Development or website development would result in me having a fulfilling career.</p>
  <p>I am currently doing a part-time, distance learning, Computer Sciences MSc. However, I found, it is severely lacking not only in modern practices in curriculum, but also practical projects. I learn best by doing, and I hope joining Founders & Coders will be a perfect opportunity to gain practical skills and build up a portfolio of projects.<p>

        <h2>Misc tidbits</h2>
        <p>I play field hockey in the local league. Great fun! This season (2017-18) is my third one in the role of Umpire Liaison Officer. My job is to coordinate umpires and assign them to games. A bit like herding cats!</p>
        <p>I enjoy gardening. This past summer I had nearly a dozen of tomato plants on the go! As always, they have been attacked by blight, but careful removal of affected parts made them survive until mid-September. When it was time for making all the green tomato chutney in the world!</p>
