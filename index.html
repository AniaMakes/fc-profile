  <h2>A bit about myself</h2>
  <p>I'm trying to think of the first time I encountered coding, and it must go all the way to high school, when we were taught basics of  Logo. At the time I found it almost too easy and too... simple - drawing circles and squares has a limited scope, after all.</p>
  <p>It wasn't until more recently that I started to think of coding more seriously.</p>
  <p>A charity I worked for was a DBS umbrella organisation and we were responsible for keeping track of applications. The only way of seeing if a certificate was issued, was to go to a particular website, input the form code and some other information. My lovely boss was doing it manually without complaining. Then she went on holiday. One day I decided to help out and do some of the tracking. Suffice to say that within 10 minutes I started to think how to automate the process. With help of a friend, I built a little script which cut down human involvement of the process from hours to minutes.</p>
  <p>One of my major motivators in life is to make a difference; to streamline and optimise processes. I think that pursuing a career in Software Development or website development would result in me having a fulfilling career.</p>
  <p>I am currently doing a part-time, distance learning, Computer Sciences MSc. However, I found, it is severely lacking in not only modern practices in curriculum, but also practical projects. I learn best by doing, and I hope joining Founders & Coders will be a perfect opportunity to gain practical skills and build up a portfolio of projects.<p>

<h2>Misc tidbits</h2>
<p>I play field hockey in the local league. Great fun! This season (2017-18) is my third one in the role of Umpire Liaison Officer. My job is to coordinate umpires and assign them to games. A bit like herding cats!</p>
<p>I enjoy gardening. This past summer I had nearly a dozen of tomato plants on the go! As always, they have been attacked by blight, but careful removal of affected parts made them survive until mid-September. When it was time for making all the green tomato chutney in the world!</p>
